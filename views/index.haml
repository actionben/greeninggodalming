    ## Welcome to Greening Godalming!
    We are campaigning to make a difference in our town. Greening Godalming is run by the community, for the community. We aim to help local people, businesses and the community tackle climate change and reduce carbon pollution. If each of us makes small changes, then together it will add up to a huge cut in our carbon dioxide pollution.

    So, donâ€™t delay, [email us](mailto:greening.godalming@gmail.com) to join the campaign now!

    ### Free Home Owners and Small Business Renewables Workshop
    People are genuinely interested in greening their homes but are often put off by the range of options available. Our workshop not only showed what technology is available but also talked about the costs, grants and feed-in tariffs available. We will be holding another workshop in the spring.

    ### Schools
    We are developing a project with Godalming schools to increase the students' understanding of simple measures that can be taken to cut energy consumption and reduce household bills. To find out more contact <greening.godalming@gmail.com>

    ### Businesses
    The latest project to start is aimed at local businesses. To find out more contact <greening.godalming@gmail.com>
