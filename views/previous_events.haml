    ### Eco Fair - 27 February 2010

    Greening celebrated its launch with its most successful event to date - an Eco Fair. Hundreds of people packed into the Borough hall during the event to find out what Godalming has to offer and to see how they can make themselves greener.

    The event brought together local schools, groups and organisations from across the town to showcase their green work and activities. In all there were 20 stalls from local scouts, guides and schools to the local allotment association, Surrey Hills Wood Fuel group and Waverley Council.

    The Fleur de Lys Morris dancers, a wandering panda bear and bee as well as wooden musical instruments provided the entertainment. And the Surrey Local Food Group served the refreshments.

    "It was a wonderful day and really showed that Godalming has a strong green roots that extend into the heart of the Town," said Carrie Anderson, Greening Godalmingâ€™s founder. "During March we are running the [community challenges](/challenges) and judging by the response we have had so far it will be a great success."
